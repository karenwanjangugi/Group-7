Create a dynamic routing system for a cityâ€™s transport network that optimizes bus and train schedules. 
The system should adjust for peak and off-peak traffic hours, special events that might increase passenger
load, and routine maintenance of transport vehicles. Your program aims to reduce overall travel time for passengers
enhance the frequency of service during high demand periods.
Ensure maintenance schedule without significantly disrupting the service.
